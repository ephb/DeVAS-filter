version 3.0.00

Added deva-visibility.  This extends the functionality of deva-filter to
provide estimates of likely low-vision hazards, defined as geometric
structures that may be a mobility hazard but are not co-located with
detectable visual contrast.  deva-visibility shares much of the
deva-filter code base.

Added deva-visualize-geometry, a utility program to display geometry
files used by deva-visibility.

Added a build for Windows (see INSTALLATION file).  This requires a
local build of the fftw3f, libpng, and zlib libraries.  Static linking
is used, so no installer or other support libraries are required.

Cleaned up function names for _to_radfile and _from_radfile routines.

Cleaned up define names.

Removed one extraneous include from dilate.h.

Tidy up deva-margin.h, deva-utils.h

Updated Radiance file I/O routines to version 5.1.0.

Updated JOSA A citation.

Dropped KLT filter support.

version 2.8.00

Redefined presets such that acuity values corresponded more closely to
Colenbrander, A. (2003); Aspects of vision loss-visual functions and
functional vision; Visual Impairment Research, 5(3), 115-136.  Added
--presets flag to print acutal values used in the filtering.

Misc. stylistic cleanup that should not change functionality.

Slightly more agressive smoothing (larger maximum distance).

Added option to add margin around outside of input image to reduce FFT
wraparound artifacts.

Removed a redundant function prototype in deva-utils.h

version 2.7.02

Fix .gitignore in build directory

version 2.7.01

Remove name clash in RadianceColorFormat.

version 2.7.00

Add Radiance-style exposure value to in-memory DEVA_image objects. This
supports creating output image files with the same exposure setting as
the input image files, which in turn facilitates tone mapping the output
files for display purposes.

version 2.6.00

DEVA_USE_FFTW3_ALLOCATORS flag now passed through CMAKE command.

A bit more argument sanity checking.

Fixed misc. typos in comments.

Misc. renaming of support functions.

Added (and used!) a setvalue function for DEVA_image objects.
Added (and used!) a scalar multiplication function for DEVA_image objects.

Misc. changes to formatting of debugging output.

Modified bounds checking of in-memory DEVA_image objects to print source
file name and line number if an error is detected.

Added a generic samesize check function for DEVA_image objects.

Exposed dt_euclid_sq for potential use by other functions.

Removed left over SVN info string.

Cleaned up reading of RADIANCE file headers, with improved management of
the global variabiles necessitated by the way the getheader ( ) function
works.

Reading of RADIANCE files now processes EXPOSURE records.

Updated included RADIANCE source code to version 5.0.a.12, which has
fixes for Windows build.

version 2.5.03
