The DeVAS visibility analysis makes use of a number of files that
describe the local scene geometry corresponding to a particular view.
In these geometry images, each pixel contains the value of a geometry
property associated with the surface location of the corresponding pixel
in the view.  The currently used geometric properties are the xyz
position of the surface point in the model coordinate system, the
distance from the viewpoint to the surface point, and the surface normal
of surface point in the model coordinate system.

DeVAS geometry files are constructed from a Radiance .hdr image and the
oct tree from which is was generated.  [Include information about
freezing the oct file once this is sorted out.]

On Linux/unix and MacOS systems, the following command line will produce
a geometry file for one of the possible geometry types:

vwrays -fd scene.hdr | rtrace -fda `vwrays -d scene.hdr` -o? \
	scene.oct > geom.txt

where scene.hdr is the Radiance file containing the image of the scene,
scene.oct is the oct file for the scene, and -o? is

	-op	xyz position
	-on	surface normal
	-oL	distance

The standard command window for Windows does not support command
substitution, and pipes in Windows are sometimes flaky for binary data.
As a result, the following should be used with Windows:

vwrays -fa scene.hdr | rtrace -fa -ld- -oL scene.oct | ^
        devas-add-res-to-ASCII - scene.hdr > geom.txt
