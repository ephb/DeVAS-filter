Current version of Windows binaries: 4.r.00

In general, the pre-built Windows binaries will only be updated when
there are significant functional changes or bug fixes to the code.  A
fully up-to-date version of the Windows binaries can always be created
from the source code.

Windows binaries for DeVAS code are cross-complies under OpenSUSE using
ming64.
