The deva-filter simulates visibility under reduced acuity and contrast
sensitivity.  It is intended to assist architects and lighting designers
identify mobility hazards and important navigational landmarks that may
not be visible to those with low vision.

The current version only accepts RADIANCE HDR files with correct VIEW
records as input.  It only outputs RADIANCE HDR files.

The software can be built on either Linux or MacOS.  No Windows version
currently exits.

The deva-filter is described in W.B. Thompson, G.E. Legge, D.J. Kersten,
R.A. Shakespeare, and Q. Lei, "Simulating Visibility Under Reduced
Acuity and Contrast Sensitivity, Journal of the Optical Society of
America A (in press).  It is based on the algorithm described in E.
Peli, "Contrast in complex images," Journal of the Optical Society of
America A, 7, 2032-2040 (1990), augmented with parameterization based on
standard clinical measures of acuity and contrast sensitivity, a
reduction in one type of artifact produced by that algorithm, limited
support for color, and the use of HDR imagery.
