This repository provides source code for seven programs: devas-filter,
devas-visibility, make-coordinates-file, devas-visualize-geometry,
devas-compare-boundaries, luminance-boundaries, and geometry-boundaries.

- devas-filter simulates visibility under reduced acuity and contrast
  sensitivity.  It is intended to assist architects and lighting
  designers identify mobility hazards and important navigational
  landmarks that may not be visible to those with low vision.
  devas-filter only accepts Radiance HDR files with correct VIEW records
  as input.  It only outputs Radiance HDR files.

- devas-visibility provides the full functionality of devas-filter, plus
  also provides an analysis combining the output of devas-filter with
  information about scene geometry to automatically estimate likely
  visual hazards associated with mobility impediments invisible to those
  with a particular level of visual impairment.  devas-visibility accepts
  as input Radiance HDR files, plus Radiance ASCII files providing
  information about scene geometry.  It outputs a Radiance HDR file, as
  with devas-filter, and a separate PNG file with a visualization of
  estimated visual hazards.

- make-coordinates-file is a helper program used to create one of the
  input files needed by devas-visibility.

- devas-visualize-geometry is a utility program to display geometry files
  used by devas-visibility.

- devas-compare-boundaries creates a visualization of how well one set of
  boundary elements is predicted by another set of boundary elements.
  It inputs PNG files plus a coordinates file as produced by
  make-coordinates-file and outputs a PNG file.

- luminance-boundaries computes luminance boundaries using the Canny
  edge detector applied to a Radiance HDR file.

- geometry-boundaries computes geometry boundaries based on Radiance
  ASCII files providing information about scene geometry.

The software can be built on either Linux or MacOS.  Windows binaries
are also provided, cross complied on a Linux system using Mingw-w64.

The devas-filter is described in W.B. Thompson, G.E. Legge, D.J. Kersten,
R.A. Shakespeare, and Q. Lei, "Simulating Visibility Under Reduced
Acuity and Contrast Sensitivity, Journal of the Optical Society of
America A, 34(4), 2017.  This paper is available under an open access
agreement:

  https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-34-4-583

The method is based in part on the algorithm described in E.  Peli,
"Contrast in complex images," Journal of the Optical Society of America
A, 7, 2032-2040, 1990, augmented with parameterization based on standard
clinical measures of acuity and contrast sensitivity, a reduction in one
type of artifact produced by that algorithm, limited support for color,
and the use of HDR imagery.
