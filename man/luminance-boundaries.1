.SH NAME
luminance-boundaries \- calculate luminance boundaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBluminance-boundaries\fR \fIinput.hdr\fR \fIoutput.png\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Calculate luminance boundaries using the Canny edge detector as in
\fBdeva-visibility\fR.  Input is a Radiance .hdr image.  Output is a PNG
file with luminance boundary elements having a value of 255 and all
other elements having a value of 0.
.SH BUGS
Does not work well on input images generated by \fBdeva-filter\fR,
perhaps because of quantization noise in the low precision Radiance file
format.
